The grant agency's board invited him in to deliver a talk in support of his application. Leonardo delivered the 5-minute presentation he gives to schools to get them excited about partnering with Kid-periment. The board denied him the funds.A week later, he asks one of the board members why they didn’t give him the money. His organization is doing great things. The board member replies, “We didn’t hear how Kid-periment aligns with our donation strategy. It was a fun talk and you showed us some neat experiments, but it didn’t feel like a serious presentation for a substantial amount of money.”If we were analyzing this case with the rhetorical canons, what would we say misfired in Leonardo’s presentation?",

    "question": "Let’s say you’re doing a key point speech on the benefits of MOOCs for lifelong learners (that is, people who routinely try to improve knowledge areas and skill; professional development).Topic: MOOCs are better than universities for lifelong learnersI. MOOCs offer more courses that are appropriate to lifelong learners.II. MOOCs better respond to the learning needs of lifelong learners.Read the discussion of point II below and then select the option that best represents the content. MOOCs better respond to the learning needs of lifelong learners. I mean their needs as professional working adults. Why is this? Universities operate on an established timeline with set content. MOOCs don’t. MOOCs have flexible timelines and content. And this flexibility is exactly what lifelong learners need most. Traditional academic courses are dominated by their calendars. It could be 10 weeks or 15 weeks, but the course has to begin and complete at the same time. All students, regardless of experience or prior exposure are expected to master the same content at the same rate. I had this experience back in college. I took an Astronomy course. I liked it, but I wasn’t good at the math. I went in regularly to get help. I spent an inordinate amount of time working on the course, but my progress was simply too slow. I ended up dropping that course. Why? Same reason many students drop courses. The Midterm. I could grasp the material, but the class was moving too fast for me. The professor didn’t have a choice. He had to determine how quickly an “average” student in his class could grasp the material and build the syllabus to fit 15 weeks. I was below that average; others, no doubt, were above it. Didn’t matter. The calendar ruled us all. It’s not their fault, but it is inflexible. Contrast this to a MOOC. A MOOC is almost entirely self-paced. Students work on a MOOC when they have the time and move on only when they grasp something. This is sometimes called mastery learning. Learners advance to the next stage when they have mastered the current stage. My son goes up for karate belts in the same way. I took a nutrition MOOC a couple of years ago. I was able to move through the material I already knew very quickly (taking quizzes along the way). I sped through the first weeks of material in a few nights. Then I spent weeks on the next few lessons because they were challenging and I was busy. In a traditional class, I would have had to sit through weeks of material I already knew. Lifelong learners need the flexibility at the core of MOOCs. The vast majority of MOOC learners already have bachelor’s degrees and lots of work experience. Demanding that they sit in a lecture hall with 200 other students at 200 different levels doesn’t work for them. MOOCs work better for lifelong learners because they better respond to their learning needs.",

In a main point about “Changes\nto online course providers” he has the subpoint, “MOOCs are being more\nmodular.” In support of this subpoint, he’s pulling from a recent research\narticle. The article and its abstract are below.  Kizilcec, R.,\n& Schneider, E. (2015). Motivation as a Lens to Understand Online Learners:\nToward Data-Driven Design with the OLEI Scale. ACM Transactions on Computer-Human\nInteraction (TOCHI), 22(2), 1-24. Abstract: Open\nonline learning environments attract an audience with diverse motivations who\ninteract with structured courses in several ways. To systematically describe\nthe motivations of these learners, we developed the Online Learning Enrollment\nIntentions (OLEI) scale, a 13-item questionnaire derived from open-ended\nresponses to capture learners’ authentic perspectives. Although motivations\nvaried across courses, we found that each motivation predicted key behavioral\noutcomes for learners (N = 71, 475 across 14 courses). From learners’\nmotivational and behavioral patterns, we infer a variety of needs that they\nseek to gratify by engaging with the courses, such as meeting new people and\nlearning English. To meet these needs, we propose multiple design directions,\nincluding virtual social spaces outside any particular course, improved support\nfor local groups of learners, and modularization to promote accessibility and\norganization of course content. Motivations thus provide a lens for\nunderstanding online learners and designing online courses to better support\ntheir needs. Which of the\nfollowing best summarizes this article for the sub-point “MOOCs are being more\nmodular”?",
    "selectedAnswers": [
      "MOOCs are being more modular. That is, they are moving\naway from a single standard way of organizing the course. Not simply one\npathway from beginning to end. Rather, the class is broken up into separate\nmodules that learners can choose to interact with in a different order. It\nturns out that learners are often pretty good at knowing how to use a class for\ntheir needs. Researchers from Stanford looked at over 70 thousand learners in\n14 different online courses. What did they find? Motivation predicted behavior.\nIf you joined a course to meet new people, odds are you posted more in the\ndiscussion forums. If you wanted to earn a certificate, you completed more\nvideos and assignments. They concluded that online courses should allow for\ndifferent motivations. Making classes more modular is one way to do this. The\nresearchers recommended, for example, breaking up courses to allow different\nusers to use them differently based on their motivations. So, instead of having\none pathway through the material: lesson 1, followed by lesson 2, and so forth.\nThey suggested allowing for multiple pathways. A beginner may be motivated to\nlearn the material in sequential order. An advanced learner might just want the\ncourse as a reference guide. Learners should be able to organize the lectures\nchronologically or topically, based on their needs. Demands for modular control\ndrives MOOCs to become more modular. "

Right now, she argues, too many people put their recycling in the garbage. She is arguing that raising the fine from €50 to €100 will significantly improve the recycling rate, but she worries that the council won’t take her argument seriously since she is a computer programmer.

(4) Kai: But if\nsuch restrictions on children’s television become commonplace, then we will see\nsimilar restrictions popping up in adult programming, and then the government\nwill start editing out content from the news. (5) Amuro: I’m not\nsuggesting that, but I do think that censoring cartoons is in the public\ninterest.  Look at Canada.
