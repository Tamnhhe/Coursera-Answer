Movement between the main land and Staples across these land bridges was quite common. Archaeological evidence, such as oral stories, rock pictures and some ancient fossils, suggests that the Staler people, the ancestors of the Artape, used the island for hunting from as far back as 31,000 BC. However, there is no evidence of settlement or continuous habitation of the island until around 25,000 BC, when evidence of temporary camps starts. It is not until 20,000 BC that we start to see evidence of permanent dwellings.

The fossil has no carnivore tooth marks on it and was found in a shelter on a steep escarpment unsuitable for climbing by this kind of marsupial herbivore.  Only humans have the capability and dexterity to make and use these kinds of tools. This leg bone tool, therefore, was made by humans.

Note that this particular reflection had a word limit of 200-550 words, and students were instructed to reflect on the idea of being a critically reflective teacher.  Stephen Brookfield (1995), in his analysis of why critical reflection is important to teaching, suggests that “an uncritical stance towards our practice sets us up for a lifetime of frustration” (para 2).  He suggests this is because teachers can have a different view of their classrooms to what is actually going on: they are unaware. This contradiction fascinates me. While on my prac placements, I was particularly conscious of this – lessons that I thought to be fantastic or boring, when looked at through a critical eye, turned out to be the opposite, or at least more in the middle. It was frustrating, to say the least. What we had learnt in our education theory courses didn’t quite match up to real-life experience. Having my supervisor give me notes at the end really helped me in evaluating my teaching and planning the next lesson. This, coupled with my own observations of my students allowed me to more closely align what Brookfield would call the “meaning and significance” (para 2) I intended for the lesson to what the students took from it. While being observed sometimes felt a bit “big brother” and sometimes just embarrassing, I have no doubt that it made me a better teacher.

Transactional leadership is largely seen as recruiting the participation of employees through material rewards, and in cases where employees do not follow directives, through punishments. The appeal of the transactional leader is attained by appealing to employees own self-interest through such things as incentives and job security. The transactional leader is seen as someone who is responsive to external threats and directives from leaders above, and largely works within the organizational culture. Their overall objective is to maintain the status quo. Many writers feel that the transactional leader is somehow inferior to the transformational leader outlined below, but in my opinion organisations need transactional leaders as much as transformational leaders.

The transactional leader is seen as someone who is responsive to external threats and directives from leaders above, and largely works within the organizational culture. Their overall objective is to maintain the status quo. Many writers feel that the transactional leader is somehow inferior to the transformational leader outlined below, but in my opinion organisations need transactional leaders as much as transformational leaders. If an organisation had too many transformational leaders, it would be a case of ‘too many chiefs not enough Indians’. In contrast with transactional leaders, transformational leaders are seen as proactive rather than just reactive. Transformational leaders inspire followers through their ideals, idea and morals rather than ….What language issues does this excerpt have?Check two options.",

As the building is still under construction, the problem is the worst at peak hour when the workers use the lifts to bring their tools and materials up to the top floors, however he still gets a lot of complaints at other times. The building manager decides to hire a work crew to come in and try and speed up the elevators, but unfortunately they tell him it isn’t possible. The construction won’t be finished for another few months, so he needs to figure out how to get the elevators to work faster. It is starting to stress him out and the residents are getting more annoyed. On the day that the construction crew bring in the mirrors for the apartments on level 11, he notices that he receives no complaints. The complaints start up again the next day, but oddly when the mirrors are delivered for level 12 there are no complaints either. The manager suddenly realizes how he can reduce the number of complaints and installs mirrors next to the elevators on each floor.

She invests $1,000 in NEWCO in exchange for the 10,000 shares of common stock.  \n\nShe subsequently raises $150,000 in convertible notes, which she closes on March 1, 2014. The notes accrue simple interest at 12% per year.  The maturity date of the notes is March 1, 2017, at which time all principal and accrued interest are payable to the noteholders, unless the notes are converted earlier in accordance with the note terms.\n\nFrom April 1 through December 31, 2014, Ima spends $72,000 in payroll costs to develop her first product, a web application used to book doctor appointments online. All costs to develop the application are expensed as incurred. \n\nOn March 1, 2014, Ima enters into a lease agreement to rent office space for NEWCO. The terms of the lease include an upfront payment of a $3,000 security deposit to guarantee timely rent payment and provide for repairing any damages to the office that are not considered “normal wear and tear”, but which is refundable upon completion of the lease term. Rent is $3,000 per month, which includes ALL costs, including use of the office space, phones, use of common facilities and all Internet connectivity. Rent is payable in arrears (that is, payable on the first day of each month following a month during which the office space is occupied). \n\nOn September 1, 2014, she engages the services of a UX/UI consultant to provide a professional user experience in using the web application. The consultant is paid $5,000 monthly, payable on the first day of the month following the month the work is performed. \n\nOn December 1, 2014, she sells 4 annual contracts of her web application to doctor offices at a price of $60,000 per contract per year. The doctor offices have immediate use of the web application and are given 30 day payment terms. (Note: for purposes of this exercise, assume the cost of the mobile applications is negligible).\n\nASSIGNMENT - Develop a balance sheet and an income statement for NEWCO based upon the above facts.

      "Entrepreneurial mindset has five factors. They are; high need for achievement, individualism, locus of control focus, and optimism. Need for achievement is defined as having a preference for challenge, an acceptance of personal responsibility for outcomes, and a personal drive for accomplishment. Individualism means that entrepreneurs need less support or approval from others. High individualism is associated with an emphasis on individual initiative and achievement. Often results in entrepreneurs needing less support or approval from others. Control has two segments, which is autonomy and locus of control. Autonomy is an individual's belief about their level of freedom from the influence of others. Locus of control is an individual's belief that they can influence the environment in which they are found. People with higher levels of autonomy and an internal locus on control are more likely to discover an entrepreneurial opportunity. Internally-oriented locus of control people believed that they are able to influence their environment. Successful entrepreneurs are able to focus attention on a single task and see it through to completion. This leads selected individuals to react and to become successful entrepreneurs. While optimism enables entrepreneurs to try new things and attempt difficult tasks, optimism may also present negative impacts. Optimism leads entrepreneurs to frequently make judgements on subjective positive factors."
