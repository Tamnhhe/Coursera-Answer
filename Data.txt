Selected essays describing my grade 1 teacher

Ms. Ha is a lovely and talented music teacher that I have met throughout my time in grade 1. With her lovely and cute appearance, she has conquered the hearts of all the students in the class. Ms. Ha's melodious voice always brings us wonderful emotions and her gentle smile makes every lesson warm and memorable.

In addition to teaching singing, Ms. Ha is also a great teacher in imparting other interesting skills to us. She always creates conditions for us to be free to create and explore in music. From playing simple instruments to learning how to compose and perform our own music, we have had interesting and unforgettable experiences.

Ms. Ha is not only a teacher but also a companion, someone we can always trust and rely on. She always listens and cares about each student, creating conditions for us to develop and mature not only in music but also in life.

I truly love and am grateful to Ms. Ha for what she has brought to us. She is the one who ignited the passion for music in my heart and will always be the person I remember throughout my life.

Short Essay on My 1st Grade Teacher

When I was in 1st grade, Ms. Nga was my homeroom teacher. Ms. Nga has a very gentle and cheerful appearance. In the classroom, she is very strict and patient. Thanks to that strictness and patience, we have gradually progressed and developed every day. I always love Ms. Nga and consider her as my second mother, who is always by my side and supports me in my studies. I will always be grateful and remember the valuable lessons she has taught me.

An impressive essay describing my first grade teacher

I would like to share more about my feelings about Ms. Ngan, my IT teacher since I was in first grade. Ms. Ngan not only has a youthful and dynamic appearance with short hair and sportswear, but she is also a very talented and intelligent person. I really admire the way she enjoys life and works with passion and enthusiasm.

Ms. Ngan has imparted knowledge about IT to me in a very professional and effective way. Although I am a small student, Ms. Ngan always treats me like a friend and a companion in my learning journey. She always creates favorable conditions for me to understand and absorb knowledge easily. I feel very confident and progress in using the computer thanks to her dedicated guidance.

In addition, Ms. Ngan is also compassionate and willing to help students who are having difficulties. I cannot forget the times she spent extra time to help students who are slow to absorb knowledge. She always finds ways to help and encourage us to overcome difficulties, never abandoning anyone in the class.

Finally, I want to say that I am very happy to be Ms. Ngan's student. She is not only a great teacher but also a close friend and a great encouragement in my life. I will always be grateful and remember the valuable lessons she has imparted to me.

Describe the best school

My school is beautiful and simple. On a winter morning, the school is filled with fog. The schoolyard is deserted, the tall banyan tree is bare. The fallen banyan leaves fill the schoolyard, adding a warm color. Walking on the schoolyard, stepping on the dry banyan leaves is really pleasant to the ears. Inside, the classrooms are still closed. The quiet space allows me to hear every breath I take. I like moments like this. About ten minutes later, the sky brightens and the students come to school, the school becomes a noisy, bustling place.

Describe the school Short and concise

A new day begins, I happily go to school - my second home. Dong My Primary School is located on a large, quiet plot of land. The entire school is surrounded by a high fence, painted white. The school is divided into two areas: the learning area
